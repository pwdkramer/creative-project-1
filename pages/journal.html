      <b>My New Assignment</b> <i>---6 days ago</i><br>
      I received a new assignment from the Jedi Counsil today. <br>
      They asked me to travel to Dantooine and investigate rumors of some
      uncovered Jedi Ruins. <br>
      I'm not sure what there is to learn from some old fossils, but my master
      assures me that the Force lingers in these ancient places. <br>
      I hope to learn something of value out there.

      <b>In Transit</b> <i>---5 days ago</i><br>
      I'm traveling to Dantooine on a public trasport shuttle, it should
      take about 3 days to arrive. <br>
      I'm told to meet a guide for the planet when I arrive, but I have
      yet to learn the name of this individual. <br>
      The other passengers have taken to playing games of Sabaak to pass the
      time, I'm unsure whether or  not the order would frown upon me joining. <br>
      I suppose I'll have time to meditate and hope to find some clarity in
      what I am to do once I arrive.

      <b>Dantooine</b> <i>---2 days ago</i><br>
      Well, I have finally arrived at the Dantooine space port. <br>
      They say there used to be a Jedi Temple here long ago, during the
      times of the Old Republic. <br>
      I have yet to meet my guide for this place, and find myself wandering the
      outskirts of the port and waiting in the Cantina for something,
      anything to happen. <br>
      I have heard rumors of some old caves a few clicks out with some strange
      stories surrounding them, I can't help but feel a pull from the Force
      in their direction.

    <b>The Caves</b> <i>---1 day ago</i><br>
    I set off this morning in search of these caves I've heard so much about,
    I can't believe what I've found here! <br>
    The Force is strong in this place, and I've even found pockets of what
    I believe to be Kaiber Crystals! <br>
    There are parts deep in the cave though that trouble me, I feel a pull
    towards them but as I ventured in that direction, I could begin to feel
    the caves resonate with the power of the Dark Side. <br>
    How could there be such a presence in a place that has such affinity with
    the light???
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Folly</b> <i>---1 hour ago</i><br>
    Despite all my training and the warning of the Dark Side given to me time
    and time again by my masters, I couln't resist the pull coming from the
    deeper parts of the cave... <br>
    I stumbled upon an ancient structure, and what I believe to be a map,
    but there was an ancient Sith security system and now I find myself
    trapped. <br>
    I fear this cave will become my tomb... But there is such knowledge here
    trapped with me! <br>
    I only hope that my absence will cause the Order to come in search of me,
    and even if they don't arrive before I become one with the Force, they will
    find a way to use the knowledge here.
